                <article>
                    <p>You just got the call. The interview is tomorrow — or worse, in two hours. Your stomach drops. You've been job hunting for weeks, and now that the moment is here, your mind goes completely blank.</p>

                    <p>Here's the truth that experienced interviewers won't tell you: most candidates over-prepare the wrong things and under-prepare the right ones. They memorize rambling answers to every possible question but forget to research what the company actually does this year. They rehearse buzzwords but can't name one real challenge the business is facing.</p>

                    <p>Thirty focused minutes, applied to the right five areas, will put you ahead of candidates who spent three days "getting ready." This is that framework.</p>

                    <h2><span class="timer-badge">Min 1–10</span> Research the Company Like a Journalist</h2>

                    <p>Your first ten minutes are worth more than any other block. Interviewers can instantly tell who did their homework — and it shifts the entire tone of the conversation from interrogation to collaboration.</p>

                    <p>Open the company's website and do three things in rapid succession:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Find recent news.</strong> Search "[Company name] news 2025 2026" and skim the top results. A funding round, a product launch, a market expansion, a leadership change — these are conversation gold. Mentioning a specific recent development signals that you pay attention to what matters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Read their "About" or "Mission" page.</strong> Note two or three phrases that stand out. Companies use these pages to signal what they actually value beyond the corporate boilerplate. If they keep saying "customer obsession" or "radical transparency," those words should echo in your answers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify one real challenge they're facing.</strong> Is the industry contracting? Did a major competitor just launch something threatening? Are they hiring aggressively in one area, which suggests a gap? Showing awareness of business context — not just product features — is what separates candidates who get offers from those who get polite rejections.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <div class="tip-label"><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Quick tip</div>
                        Check the interviewer's LinkedIn if you know their name. A shared connection, a recent post they wrote, or a career path similar to yours gives you an instant, genuine talking point that almost no other candidate will have.
                    </div>

                    <h2><span class="timer-badge">Min 10–20</span> Map Your Experience to Their Top 3 Requirements</h2>

                    <p>Pull up the job description and highlight the three requirements that appear most prominently — usually in the first paragraph of "What you'll do" and repeated in "What we're looking for." These are the skills the hiring manager is actually evaluated on, and they should structure your entire story.</p>

                    <p>For each requirement, draft one STAR story you can tell in under two minutes:</p>

                    <div class="star-grid">
                        <div class="star-cell">
                            <div class="star-letter">S</div>
                            <p>Situation — set the scene in one sentence</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="star-cell">
                            <div class="star-letter">T</div>
                            <p>Task — what specifically was your responsibility</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="star-cell">
                            <div class="star-letter">A</div>
                            <p>Action — what you did, in your own words</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="star-cell">
                            <div class="star-letter">R</div>
                            <p>Result — a number, outcome, or change you can point to</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The result is the part most candidates skip. "We improved efficiency" is forgettable. "We cut onboarding time from six weeks to three, which let the team take on two additional accounts that quarter" is a story someone remembers when they're deciding between finalists.</p>

                    <p>Don't try to cover everything from your resume. Three tight, specific stories told well beat ten vague ones every time. Write your three stories in bullet form — situation in one line, action in two, result in one. That's all you need.</p>

                    <h2><span class="timer-badge">Min 20–25</span> Prepare 3 Smart Questions to Ask Them</h2>

                    <p>When the interviewer asks "Do you have any questions for us?" — and they always do — this is not a polite formality. It's the moment that often determines the final decision. Candidates who ask nothing signal low interest. Candidates who ask generic questions signal low preparation. Candidates who ask sharp, specific questions signal that they're already thinking like someone on the team.</p>

                    <p>Avoid questions that can be answered by the website. Instead, aim for questions that reveal thinking:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"What does success look like in this role after 90 days?"</strong> — This shows you're focused on delivering value, not just landing the job. It also tells you whether they have a clear vision for the position.</li>
                        <li><strong>"What's the biggest challenge the team is navigating right now?"</strong> — This is the question most interviewers wish candidates asked more. Their answer tells you what you'd actually be dealing with, and your response lets you briefly connect it to something from your experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>"How did you land here, and what's kept you?"</strong> — Asking the interviewer about their own story humanizes the conversation and often reveals something real about the culture that no Glassdoor review captures.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Write your three questions down. Even if you end up asking different ones, the act of preparing them keeps you from going blank at a critical moment.</p>

                    <h2><span class="timer-badge">Min 25–30</span> Review Your Resume and Nail Your Intro</h2>

                    <p>Spend five minutes doing the two things that sound obvious but most people skip: re-reading your own resume as submitted, and rehearsing your "tell me about yourself" answer out loud.</p>

                    <p>Skimming your resume before you walk in prevents the embarrassing freeze when an interviewer says "walk me through this gap" or "what did you do at [company] again?" You want your own timeline to be completely fresh in your mind, not something you have to reconstruct under pressure.</p>

                    <p>Your "tell me about yourself" answer should be 60 to 90 seconds, no longer. Structure it as a career arc — where you started, what you moved toward, and why this role is the logical next chapter. End it with something that creates a natural handoff: "...which is what drew me to this position, because [one specific thing about the company or role]." That one specific thing should come directly from your first-ten-minutes research.</p>

                        Say your intro out loud, not just in your head. Speaking activates different memory than reading. If you stumble on a sentence twice, simplify it before you get in the room.

                    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-star" style="color:var(--accent-color);font-size:1rem;"></i> Bonus: Practice With an AI Interviewer Before You Go In</h2>

                    <p>All five steps above can be done solo — but the hardest part of interview prep has always been simulating the actual pressure of being asked an unexpected question and having to think out loud in real time. That's what practice interviews with a human are supposed to solve, but scheduling a mock interview in the next 30 minutes is rarely an option.</p>

                    <p>TailorMeSwiftly's mock interview feature gives you a realistic AI interviewer that asks role-specific questions, listens to your answers, and gives you honest feedback on structure, specificity, and delivery. You can run through your three STAR stories and see immediately which ones land and which ones wander. You can practice your "tell me about yourself" until the pacing feels natural. And you can do it all in 10 minutes, right after you finish the framework above.</p>

                    <p>Preparation builds confidence. Confidence changes outcomes. The candidates who get offers aren't always the most experienced ones — they're the ones who walk in sounding like they've already done the job.</p>
