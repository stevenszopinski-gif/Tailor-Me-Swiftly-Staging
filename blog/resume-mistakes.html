                        <p class="blog-post-intro">
                            Recruiters spend an average of six seconds scanning your resume before deciding whether you move forward or get filed under "no." That's not a lot of runway. The brutal truth is that most rejections happen before a human ever reads a word — because a poorly structured resume never gets past the ATS. Here are the ten most common mistakes that sink candidates, and exactly how to fix them.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="blog-post-body">

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">1</span> Using an Objective Statement Instead of a Professional Summary</h2>
                        <p>The "Objective" section died with fax machines. Phrases like <em>"Seeking a challenging role where I can grow my skills"</em> tell the recruiter nothing useful — and worse, they waste the most valuable real estate on your resume: the top third of page one.</p>
                        <p>Replace it with a <strong>2–4 line professional summary</strong> that leads with your title, your years of relevant experience, and one or two concrete differentiators. Think of it as your elevator pitch in writing. Recruiters want to know immediately what you bring to the table, not what you hope to get out of the job.</p>
                        <div class="tip-box"><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> <strong>Fix it:</strong> Start your summary with something like: <em>"Results-driven marketing manager with 7 years of B2B SaaS experience, specializing in demand generation and pipeline growth."</em></div>

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">2</span> Including Irrelevant Work Experience</h2>
                        <p>A resume is not a life history — it's a targeted marketing document. Listing every job you've ever held, including the summer you waited tables in 2009, creates noise that buries your relevant experience and signals a lack of self-awareness.</p>
                        <p>As a rule, go back no more than <strong>10–15 years</strong> unless an older role is directly relevant to the position you're applying for. If you're a senior engineer, your high school internship should not be on your resume. Prioritize recency and relevance every time.</p>

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">3</span> Vague Bullet Points Without Metrics</h2>
                        <p>"Managed social media accounts." "Improved team efficiency." "Responsible for client relationships." These bullet points are nearly meaningless. Every candidate says something similar. What hiring managers actually want to see is the <em>scale and impact</em> of your work.</p>
                        <p>Quantify wherever you can. Numbers stand out visually and are far more persuasive than adjectives. Even rough estimates beat vague descriptions.</p>
                        <div class="tip-box"><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> <strong>Fix it:</strong> <em>"Grew Instagram following from 4K to 38K in 12 months, driving a 22% increase in inbound leads."</em> That's a bullet point worth reading.</div>

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">4</span> Typos and Grammar Errors</h2>
                        <p>This one seems obvious, but it remains one of the top reasons candidates get rejected at the screening stage. A typo signals carelessness — and if you can't proofread a two-page document that represents your professional future, what does that say about your attention to detail on the job?</p>
                        <p>Spell-check is not enough. Read your resume out loud. Print it out and read it backwards, sentence by sentence. Have a trusted friend or colleague review it. Run it through a grammar tool. <strong>One typo can cost you the interview.</strong></p>

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">5</span> Using Fancy Templates with Tables and Graphics</h2>
                        <p>That beautifully designed two-column resume with icons, progress bars for skill levels, and a colored sidebar might look impressive to a human — but ATS software often chokes on it entirely. Tables, text boxes, headers, footers, and graphics can all cause parsing errors, meaning your skills and experience may never get extracted correctly.</p>
                        <p>Stick to a <strong>clean, single-column format</strong> with standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills), a standard font, and no graphics. Simple beats stylish when robots are reading first.</p>

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">6</span> Listing Duties Instead of Achievements</h2>
                        <p>Your job description tells a recruiter what you were supposed to do. Your resume should tell them what you actually accomplished. There is a massive difference between "Responsible for managing a sales team" and "Led a 12-person sales team to 134% of quota in Q3, the highest performance in the company's history."</p>
                        <p>For every bullet point, ask yourself: <strong>so what?</strong> What was the outcome? What changed because of your work? Frame your experience through results, not responsibilities.</p>

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">7</span> Missing Keywords from the Job Description</h2>
                        <p>ATS systems scan for specific keywords before a human ever sees your resume. If the job description mentions "Salesforce CRM," "cross-functional collaboration," or "agile methodology," and those exact phrases don't appear in your resume, your application may be filtered out automatically — even if you're highly qualified.</p>
                        <p>Read each job description carefully and mirror the language it uses. Don't stuff keywords unnaturally, but do make sure your resume speaks the same vocabulary as the role. This is one of the most impactful and overlooked optimizations candidates can make.</p>
                        <div class="tip-box"><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> <strong>Fix it:</strong> TailorMeSwiftly's AI automatically matches your resume to the job description keywords so you don't have to do this manually for every application.</div>

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">8</span> Too Long or Too Short</h2>
                        <p>There are two versions of this mistake. The first: a three-page resume from someone with four years of experience, padded with fluff and irrelevant detail. The second: a half-page resume from a senior professional with fifteen years of accomplishments who somehow undersells everything.</p>
                        <p><strong>The guideline is one page per decade of relevant experience</strong>, with one page being ideal for most candidates and two pages acceptable for senior roles. Go beyond two pages only if you're in academia, research, or a highly technical field where a CV format is expected. Every line should earn its place.</p>

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">9</span> Unprofessional Email Address</h2>
                        <p>It seems trivial, but recruiters notice. An email address like <em>partyguy1993@hotmail.com</em> or <em>sexyredhair@yahoo.com</em> is a legitimate red flag. It suggests a lack of professional judgment and can cast a shadow over an otherwise strong application.</p>
                        <p>Create a dedicated professional email address — ideally a variation of your name — on Gmail. If your name is common, try adding your industry or a middle initial. Make it something you'd be comfortable seeing on a business card.</p>

                        <h2><span class="mistake-num">10</span> No Customization Per Application</h2>
                        <p>Sending the same resume to every job is the single fastest way to get ignored at scale. Hiring managers can tell when they're reading a generic document. A resume tailored to the specific role, company, and team reads completely differently from a one-size-fits-all version — and it performs dramatically better.</p>
                        <p>At minimum, customize your professional summary, reorder your bullet points to prioritize the most relevant achievements, and ensure your keyword coverage matches the posting. Yes, this takes time. That's exactly why tools like TailorMeSwiftly exist — to do the heavy lifting in seconds so you can apply smarter, not harder.</p>

                        <hr class="blog-divider">

                        <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
                        <p>Most of these mistakes are fixable in an afternoon. A resume audit — where you read your resume critically against a real job description — can surface every one of them. The goal is a document that clears ATS filters, earns a six-second scan from a recruiter, and then holds up under closer scrutiny in a phone screen.</p>
                        <p>You don't need a perfect resume. You need a <em>relevant</em> one. Targeted, clean, achievement-focused, and keyword-matched to the role you actually want.</p>
