            <!-- Article body -->
            <article>

                <p>You've done the hard part. You survived the application filter, nailed the phone screen, passed the panel interviews, and the hiring manager just said the words you've been waiting to hear: <strong>"We'd like to extend you an offer."</strong> The next five minutes will determine whether you earn $15,000 more per year — or quietly leave money on the table for the rest of your career.</p>

                <p>Most people don't negotiate. They accept the first number, relief flooding their system before their brain catches up. This guide gives you the research, the timing, and the exact words to say so that doesn't happen to you.</p>

                <h2>1. Why Most People Don't Negotiate — and What It Really Costs</h2>

                <p>A 2023 survey by Salary.com found that <strong>only 37% of workers always negotiate salary</strong>, while 18% never do. The most common reasons: fear of losing the offer, uncertainty about how to ask, and not knowing what they're actually worth.</p>

                <p>Here's the math on that hesitation. If you accept a $75,000 offer when you could have negotiated to $90,000, you don't just lose $15,000 this year. Future raises, bonuses, and retirement contributions are often calculated as percentages of your base salary. Over a 30-year career, that single missed conversation compounds into <strong>$500,000 or more in lost earnings.</strong></p>

                <p>And employers expect candidates to negotiate. Recruiters typically have a range approved by HR. The first number they share is almost never the ceiling — it's the floor with room built in.</p>

                <h2>2. The Preparation: Research Market Rates and Know Your Walkaway Number</h2>

                <p>You cannot negotiate confidently without data. Before any offer conversation, spend 30 minutes building your number:</p>

                <p><strong>Pull salary data from at least three sources.</strong> Levels.fyi and Glassdoor are good starting points for tech roles. LinkedIn Salary, Payscale, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook cover broader industries. Look at your specific title, metro area, and years of experience — not just the national average.</p>

                <p><strong>Set your target and walkaway number.</strong> Your target is the specific figure you'll ask for — ambitious but defensible. Your walkaway number is the minimum you'd actually accept. The gap between the two is your negotiating range. Never reveal your walkaway number. Never anchor low by stating a range when you can state a single number.</p>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i>
                    <div class="tip-box-body">
                        <strong>Research tip:</strong> If the job posting listed a salary range, assume you can negotiate to the top 25% of that range, or above it if your research justifies it. Postings often reflect budget minimums, not maximums.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>3. The Timing: When to Bring Up Salary in the Process</h2>

                <p>Timing is as important as the script itself. The golden rule: <strong>let the employer make the first move.</strong> Whoever names a number first is at a disadvantage. If you're asked about salary expectations early in the process, deflect with something like:</p>

                <div class="script-block">
                    <p>"I'd love to learn more about the full scope of the role before discussing compensation. Could we revisit that once I have a clearer picture of the responsibilities and how this team operates?"</p>
                </div>

                <p>If you're pushed for a number before an offer, give a researched range — but anchor it high. State the top of your range as if it's the middle. This leaves room to negotiate down without losing ground.</p>

                <p>The ideal moment to negotiate is after a verbal offer but <strong>before you've signed anything in writing.</strong> You have maximum leverage right now: the company has invested weeks of interview cycles in you, the hiring manager wants this done, and HR has already gotten internal approval for a range.</p>

                <h2>4. The Script: Exact Phrases to Use When Countering</h2>

                <p>When the offer arrives, thank them warmly, then pause. Don't accept in the moment. Ask for 24–48 hours to review. Then make your counter in writing or on a follow-up call using language like this:</p>

                <div class="script-block">
                    <p>"I'm really excited about this role and I've been genuinely impressed by the team throughout the process. I was hoping we could discuss the base salary. Based on my research into market rates for this level of experience in [city], and considering [specific skill or achievement], I was expecting something closer to [your target number]. Is there flexibility to get closer to that?"</p>
                </div>

                <p>A few principles baked into that script: you opened with enthusiasm (not ultimatum energy), you cited external data (not personal need), you named a specific number (not a vague "more"), and you ended with a question that invites dialogue rather than confrontation.</p>

                <p><strong>Never apologize for asking.</strong> Never say "I know this might be a lot to ask" or "I'm not sure if this is possible, but..." Hedging language signals that you don't believe the ask is reasonable. If your research backs up the number, state it plainly.</p>

                <h2>5. Handling "That's the Best We Can Do" — 3 Strategies</h2>

                <p>Recruiters are trained to test your resolve. "That's our best offer" is a negotiating position, not a final answer. Here's how to respond:</p>

                <ul class="strategy-list">
                    <li>
                        <span class="num">1</span>
                        <div><strong>The Pause and Reframe.</strong> Don't fill the silence. Let a beat pass, then say: "I understand there may be constraints. Can you help me understand what the typical salary trajectory looks like for this role in the first 12–18 months? A faster path to a review would definitely help me feel confident about the starting number." You've pivoted from a fixed number to a timeline — easier for HR to approve.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="num">2</span>
                        <div><strong>The Escalation Ask.</strong> "I completely respect that. Would it be possible to loop in [hiring manager's name] for a quick conversation? They've seen my work through the process and may have additional context that could help." This isn't aggressive — it's collegial. And hiring managers often have budget flexibility that HR does not.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="num">3</span>
                        <div><strong>The Anchor Hold.</strong> Simply restate your number with calm confidence: "I hear you, and I appreciate the transparency. I do want to make this work — I'm just not in a position to accept below [target number] given what the market shows for this role. Is there anything else on the table we haven't explored yet?" Then let them respond. Often they'll find something.</div>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Negotiating Beyond Base Salary: Sign-On, Equity, PTO, and Remote</h2>

                <p>Base salary is just one line on the offer letter. If the employer genuinely cannot move on base, the total compensation conversation is still very much open. Consider negotiating these:</p>

                <p><strong>Sign-on bonus.</strong> This is a one-time payment that often comes from a different budget than base salary. If you're leaving unvested equity or a year-end bonus at your current job, a sign-on is a completely reasonable ask. Frame it as making you whole for what you're leaving behind.</p>

                <p><strong>Equity or RSUs.</strong> At startups and public tech companies, stock grants can dwarf base salary in total value. Ask about the vesting schedule, cliff, strike price (if options), and the last 409A valuation. A larger equity grant or accelerated vesting can easily be worth tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

                <p><strong>PTO and flexibility.</strong> An extra week of PTO is worth roughly 2% of your salary — and it costs the company nothing upfront. Similarly, negotiating full remote or a flexible schedule has real monetary value when you factor in commuting costs and time. Don't overlook it.</p>

                <p><strong>Professional development budget.</strong> Conference attendance, certifications, and learning budgets are often negotiable and rarely tracked as tightly as salary. A $3,000 annual learning budget is real money, especially in technical fields where certifications matter.</p>

                        <strong>Get everything in writing.</strong> Verbal promises about future raises, remote work policies, or sign-on bonuses mean nothing if they aren't in the offer letter or a written email from HR. Before you sign, confirm that every negotiated item is documented.

                <h2>7. Practice Until It Feels Natural</h2>

                <p>Reading a script is not the same as delivering it confidently under pressure. The biggest predictor of negotiation success isn't the words you choose — it's how calm and certain you sound when you say them. Nervousness leaks through in vocal fry, filler words, and rushed sentences, and recruiters are trained to read all of it.</p>

                <p>The fix is repetition. Run the negotiation conversation out loud until the phrasing feels natural — not rehearsed. Practice with a trusted friend who can push back. Record yourself on your phone and listen back. Notice where you hedge, where you speed up, where your voice drops.</p>

                <p>Better yet, use a tool built specifically for this. TailorMeSwiftly's AI Salary Negotiator lets you run realistic practice scenarios against a simulated recruiter — one that pushes back, tests your resolve, and gives you specific feedback on your phrasing and tone. It also analyzes any offer you input and surfaces leverage points you might have missed, including comp benchmarks for your role and location.</p>

                <p>Salary negotiation is a skill. It can be learned, practiced, and improved — just like any other part of the job search. The five minutes after you receive an offer are among the highest-ROI minutes of your entire career. Show up prepared.</p>
